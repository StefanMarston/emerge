# emerge
A bash code that extends the usbility of ubuntu packet managers (snap/apt/flatpak/homebrew)

How to add emerge to your system:

Please keep in mind that this versio is ONLY for ubuntu.

# CLI
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/StefanMarston/emerge/blob/main/bashrc.bash>
cd ~/Downloads/bashrc.bash
^A ^C ^X n
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
^_ 100 ^V ^O ^X
```
# GUI
```bash
open Downloads directory and search for 'emerge'
open it and shortcut ^A ^C ^X n
open the .bashrc (in your home directory)
^_ 100 ^V ^O ^X
```

Please remind that editing .bashrc can destroy your bash/shell prompt. Be gentue while editing it and refer to https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html as the keyboard shortcuts which I used are for the layout 'German - No deadkeys'.

More distros will follow really soon!
